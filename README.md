<p># My Journey to Learning Pandas</p>

<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey to learning Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. This repo showcases my progress and projects using two datasets:</p>

<p>1. **People Dataset**: A self-built dataset structured as a dictionary named 'People'. 2. **Stack Overflow Survey 2019**: A comprehensive dataset from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.</p>

<p>## Contents</p>

<p>- **People Dataset Exploration**: Insights and analyses from my custom 'People' dataset. - **Stack Overflow Analysis**: In-depth exploration of the 2019 Stack Overflow survey data. - **Learning Notes**: Key concepts and techniques I&rsquo;ve learned along the way.</p>

<p>## Goals</p>

<p>- Understand and apply data manipulation techniques with Pandas. 
<p>- Gain proficiency in handling real-world datasets. 
<p>- Document and share my learning process to help others on a similar path.</p>

<p>Feel free to explore the repository and follow along with my journey!</p>
